                When I was a kid, I took apart a toy just to see how it worked.
                Didn‚Äôt manage to put it back together. Still remember how that
                felt‚Äîcurious, messy, kinda proud.
              </p>
              <p>That hasn‚Äôt changed much.</p>
              <p>
                These days, I design interfaces for SaaS tools, early-stage
                products, and teams who care about clarity. I don‚Äôt do ‚Äúmake it
                pretty.‚Äù I do <em>make it make sense</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ask a lot of questions. Fix flows. Move things around until
                everything feels right. It‚Äôs not about showing off. It‚Äôs about
                helping someone think,

                I work quietly and quickly. I collaborate when it counts, but I

                What keeps me going? Figuring things out. That moment when it

                I spend a lot of time reading. Usually nonfiction‚Äîstuff about
                how people think, how we work, and how to talk without
                overthinking every word. It helps. Quietly.

                I collect Hot Wheels too. Been doing it for years. There‚Äôs
                something about how tiny and well-designed they are. Over 200
                now. Still feels exciting when I find a good one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lately, I‚Äôve been working on soft skills. Listening better.
                Talking clearer. Saying less, but meaning more.

                I live with my wife and our dog, Milo. We go hiking or camping
                when we can. Not for the views‚Äîmostly for the quiet. It resets
                me.
