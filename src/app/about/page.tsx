                When I was a kid, I took apart a toy just to see how it worked.
                Didn‚Äôt manage to put it back together. Still remember how that
                felt‚Äîcurious, messy, kinda proud.

              <p>That hasn‚Äôt changed much.</p>
              <p>
                These days, I design interfaces for SaaS tools, early-stage
                products, and teams who care about clarity. I don‚Äôt do ‚Äúmake it
                pretty.‚Äù I do <em>make it make sense</em>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I ask a lot of questions. Fix flows. Move things around until
                everything feels right. It‚Äôs not about showing off. It‚Äôs about
                helping someone think,

                I work quietly and quickly. I collaborate when it counts, but I

                What keeps me going? Figuring things out. That moment when it

                I spend a lot of time reading.
                <br />
                Usually nonfiction‚Äîstuff about how people think, how we work,
                and how to talk without overthinking every word.
                <br />
                It helps. Quietly.

                I collect Hot Wheels too. Been doing it for years.
                <br />
                There‚Äôs something about how tiny and well-designed they are.
                <br />
                Over 200 now. Still feels exciting when I find a good one.

                Lately, I‚Äôve been working on soft skills.
                <br />
                Listening better. Talking clearer. Saying less, but meaning
                more.

                I live with my wife and our dog, Milo.
                <br />
                We go hiking or camping when we can.
                <br />
                Not for the views‚Äîmostly for the quiet. It resets me.
