# Mdx Stylet Test

When you're showcasing your design work or explaining a product, plain screenshots aren’t always enough.

Sometimes, you need to show the *actual* prototype. Or let readers watch a demo without leaving the page.

That’s where embeds come in.

## Figma Embed

Let’s say you’re writing about a recent design project. Instead of just describing the interaction, you want people to *feel* it.

Here’s how you can embed a Figma prototype directly:



```
<iframe
  style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
  width="800"
  height="450"
  src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https://www.figma.com/proto/YOUR-FIGMA-FILE-ID"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

```

Make sure to replace `YOUR-FIGMA-FILE-ID` with your actual file or prototype URL.

Once added, it should look like this:

\[Your Figma embed will display here]

***

## YouTube Video Embed

Maybe you’re doing a walk-through of your design. Uploading that to YouTube and embedding it is easy:

Once live, the video will sit inside your blog post and play directly from there.

***

## Loom Video Embed

If you use Loom for async recordings, you can embed those too.

Here’s how:

```
html
```

Swap out the `YOUR-LOOM-VIDEO-ID` with your actual video ID from Loom.

***

## Final Thoughts

Try spacing out your text around embeds like this.

Keep a short paragraph above and below each embed.

That way, the visual flow feels clean. Readers won’t get overwhelmed, and your content becomes more engaging.

Let me know if you want a version that also includes buttons, callouts, or tabs.
