# Testing Our Custom Figure Component

Below is an example using our custom Figure component:

<Figure
  src="/content/the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-ichiro-kishimi--fumitake-koga---visual-selection.png"
  alt="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  caption="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
/>

## Centered Figure

<Figure
  src="/content/the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-ichiro-kishimi--fumitake-koga---visual-selection.png"
  alt="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  caption="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  align="center"
/>

## Right-aligned Figure

<Figure
  src="/content/the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-ichiro-kishimi--fumitake-koga---visual-selection.png"
  alt="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  caption="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  align="right"
/>

## Legacy Frame Component vs Figure Component

### Legacy Frame way (still works)

<Frame caption="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right.">
  <Image
    src="/content/the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-ichiro-kishimi--fumitake-koga---visual-selection.png"
    alt="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  />
</Frame>

### New Figure way (simpler and more flexible)

```jsx
// The old way
<Frame caption="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right.">
  <Image
    src="/content/the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-ichiro-kishimi--fumitake-koga---visual-selection.png"
    alt="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  />
</Frame>

// The new way - cleaner and supports alignment
<Figure
  src="/content/the-courage-to-be-disliked-by-ichiro-kishimi--fumitake-koga---visual-selection.png"
  alt="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  caption="A lone figure walking left. A crowd facing right."
  align="center"
/>
```
