Most designers wait for a brief.

I didn’t.

I started with a blurry idea, a bit of hunger, and a lot of late nights. Not the “hustle” kind. Just me trying to figure things out alone, designing for small clients who couldn’t always pay, but trusted me anyway.

That’s where I learned the real weight of a vision.

Not just what you say in a deck. But the kind that keeps you up at 1:00 AM adjusting pixels, wondering if any of this will work.

That’s how I started thinking like a founder.

And that shift changed everything.

### Start with your own clarity

If you're a founder working with a designer, here’s something to think about:

Good design starts with clarity.

Not just about the product, but about why you’re building it in the first place.

When I design for my own projects, I don’t start in Figma.

I start with questions like:

- What’s broken?
- Who’s in pain?
- And why me?

The same should go for your startup. That clarity is your anchor. It makes feedback sharper. It saves weeks of guessing. And it helps your designer actually become a creative partner, not a tool.

### Be okay with weird ideas

Some of my best client results started with awkward ideas.

One startup founder I worked with didn’t want a homepage. At all. Just a demo. Everyone thought it was a mistake. But it worked, because that decision came from their audience insight, not from trend-following.

I’ve learned to trust those moments.

Design isn’t always about making things prettier.

It’s about seeing what no one else has tried yet — and making that safe enough for users to try, too.

That’s the mindset I bring as a freelance designer. I don’t just design what you ask for. I help push it somewhere your competitors haven’t thought of yet.

### Your brand isn't just visuals

I get asked about branding a lot.

“What colors should we use?”

“Should we go minimalist?”

My answer’s always the same:

If your users don’t feel anything, no color palette will save you.

Think about the vibe your product gives off.

How does it feel when someone lands on your site?

Does your design make people trust you — or click away?

I’ve helped brands rebuild their identity by starting from stories, not styles. We talk to customers. We look at behavior. We figure out what already feels true — and we design to turn that into a feeling users can recognize in 3 seconds.

### It’s hard. Do it anyway.

Running your own thing, whether you’re a founder or a freelance designer, is heavy.

Some days, you doubt everything.

You go weeks with no new leads.

Your best idea gets no traction.

You question your taste. Your timing. Your pricing.

I’ve been there. Still go there sometimes.

What helps?

Talking to others who are in it too. Celebrating small wins. Taking breaks before you burn out. And reminding yourself why you started in the first place.

That’s what keeps me showing up — for my clients, for my projects, for myself.

And if you’re building something and want a designer who gets that? Someone who’s sat in the “founder seat” too, not just the design corner?

Let’s talk.
